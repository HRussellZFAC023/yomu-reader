# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes should be recorded here. The documentation site includes this file directly, so updating this changelog also updates the website.

### Added

- Added the GitHub Pages documentation site with beginner-friendly install instructions, feature docs, support links, and Playwright screenshots.
